Git flow is chosen as branch strategy for this project for several reasons:

. As described in the project artifacts, we have releases in every 2 weeks for pre-prod and monthly for prod.
git flow is adjusted to such schedules since it consists of small, medium or large changes supported from hot_fix,
release and feature branches
. It does not require to interact with main branch which would be high risk for financial data processing.
. It enables as to have separate branch called develop for development.
This option will enable us to keep away from main branch from which our product deploy on production.
. QA branch is also applicable to support data quality framework.

Merging:
. hot_fix, release and feature branches will be merged with develop or qa
. develop can be merged with main
